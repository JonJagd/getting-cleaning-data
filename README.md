# How the script works
The script run_analysis.R can be executed as one single exectution with the data and data structure for the UCI HAR Dataset, and it will result in one outputfile named mySubmissionWeek4GettigCleaningData.txt in your working directory.
You need to make sure that your working directory is in the folder, where you have all the files in the UCI HAR Dataset. Running the command dir() should result in the following contents from the UCI HAR Dataset with  at least the test and train folders and their original contents:
> dir()
[1] "activity_labels.txt" "features.txt"        "features_info.txt"   "README.txt"          "test"               
[6] "train"    

# Code book describing the variables
